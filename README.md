# Learning to exploit market power in electricity markets through portfolio-level bidding

---

## Overview

This code uses the RL-strategy for an electricity portfolio operator as described in the paper, and includes:

- A simplified market benchmarked against marginal cost bidding, MADRL, and bilevel optimization
- A large-scale market representing the German market in 2019
